These are a few small utilities for use with XBPS:
https://github.com/voidlinux/xbps

  xbranch [-d] branch [repository] - (de-)publish a local git branch
  xbulk [-n] [-k] [xbps-src flags...] PKGS... - simple XBPS bulk builder
  xbump PKGNAME [git commit options] - git commit a version bump
  xcheckrestart [-v] - list programs using outdated libraries
  xclash - detect file conflicts between XBPS packages
  xdiff [-u|-l] [DIR] - merge/diff/list XBPS .new-* files
  xdistdir - figure out XBPS_DISTDIR
  xdowngrade PKGS.xbps... - install XBPS package directly from .xbps file
  xgensum [-i] TEMPLATE - update SHA256 sums in templates
  xgrep PATTERN PKGS... - search files limited to XBPS package contents
  xhog - list installed XBPS packages ordered by size
  xlg PKG - open short commit log for XBPS template
  xlint TEMPLATE - scan XBPS template for common mistakes
  xlocate [-u | PATTERN] - locate files in all XBPS packages
  xlog PKG - open commit log for XBPS template
  xls PKGS... - list files contained in PKGS (including binpkgs)
  xmandoc MANPAGE - read manpage of possibly not installed package
  xmindep PKGS... - minimize list of PKGS by removing implicit dependencies
  xnew PKG - create XBPS template template
  xnodev - list not installed -devel packages for installed packages
  xoptdiff [-q] [PKGS...] - show template options which differ from binary package
  xpstree - display tree view of xbps-src processes

  xrevbump MESSAGE TEMPLATES... - increase template revision and commit

Tools working on the void-packages tree use xdistdir to find it,
check its output is reasonable first.
